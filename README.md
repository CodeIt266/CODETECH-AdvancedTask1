Overview of the Project

Project: Create tool for FILE INTEGRITY CHECKER

Objective:- The File Integrity Checker is a tool designed to verify the authenticity and integrity of files by generating their SHA-256 hash values. It scans a specified directory, identifies file types, and provides a detailed report with file descriptions and hash values. This tool helps ensure files have not been changed or corrupted, making it useful for maintaining data security and accuracy. The tool categorizes files based on their extensions, making it easy to understand their purpose. It ensures thorough scanning by processing all files in the selected directory, including subfolders. With its clear reporting, the File Integrity Checker is an essential solution for verifying data reliability in professional and personal use.

Key Activities:-

1. Password Evaluation and Scoring: Analyze password length, complexity, and uniqueness to assign a security score.

2. Common Password Check: Cross-check passwords against a database of commonly used ones to flag weak or easily guessable options.

3. Complexity Assessment: Ensure passwords include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters to enhance strength.

4. Uniqueness Check: Detect repetitive patterns or characters that could compromise password security.

5. Feedback and Suggestions: Provide clear, actionable recommendations to help users create more secure and robust passwords.

Technologies Used:-

1. Python: Used to implement the password strength logic and scoring.

2. string Module (Python): Helps access character sets for complexity checks.

3. Conditional Statements and Loops: Evaluate password attributes and calculate strength.

4. Input/Output Operations: Handle user input and display feedback.

Key Insights:- The File Integrity Checker tool ensures the authenticity of files by comparing their SHA-256 hash values. It detects unauthorized changes or corruption, helping to maintain data security. The tool scans entire directories, including subfolders, and classifies files based on their extensions. This provides users with clear insights into the types of files being verified. Its simple, readable reports allow quick assessment of file integrity and prompt action when needed. By safeguarding file integrity, the tool helps protect sensitive information and ensures data accuracy in professional environments.
